Our first photography class graduated Just before the 2019 Covid pandemic. Over the past three years we’ve earnest our skills of visual storytelling capturing some of the momentous occasions happening here and around. From sports, religion, healthcare, arts and fashion to the pandemic and the 2022 Kenyan general elections. In this we’re showcasing for the first time works of 10 photographers we’ve been on the field with.

Kibera is growing at a first pace, with lots of stories to tell. What seems to triumph despite the shot backs from the social community we’re in is the ever; hard working, creative, and above all it’s a changing community. Canvassed by a visual metaphor that transcends localities - just at the backyards of Nairobi business District. Kibera is facing The pressures of big city growth With mass movements and these leads social issues. The exhibition highlight these movements and how the community faced the pandemic and above how has this place changed since we were kids?

We hope you enjoy this first exhibition by photographers from kibera.</p>
